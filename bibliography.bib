    abstract = {This study reports and analyzes the results of the second round
                of the computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
                The object is to gain a deeper understanding of how to perform
                well in such a setting. The 62 entrants were able to draw
                lessons from the results of the first round and were able to
                design their entries to take these lessons into account. The
                results of the second round demonstrate a number of subtle
                pitfalls which specific types of decision rules can encounter.
                The winning rule was once again TIT FOR TAT, the rule which
                cooperates on the first move and then does what the other player
                did on the previous move. The analysis of the results shows the
                value of not being the first to defect, of being somewhat
                forgiving, but also the importance of being provocable. An
                analysis of hypothetical alternative tournaments demonstrates
                the robustness of the results.},
